# Predicting Stroke Risk Based on Medical and Lifestyle Features

This project explores the use of machine learning classification methods to predict whether a patient is at risk of having a stroke, based on demographic, health, and lifestyle features. The dataset contains over 5,000 observations with variables such as age, gender, hypertension, average glucose level, body mass index, and smoking status. After preprocessing the data and encoding categorical variables, we apply multiple classification algorithms—including logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting—and evaluate their performance using metrics like F1 score and AUC. Special attention is given to the class imbalance problem, since only a small fraction of patients in the dataset experienced a stroke.
